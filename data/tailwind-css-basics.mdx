# Introduction to Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a **utility-first CSS framework** that allows you to build modern user interfaces directly in your markup.  
Instead of writing custom CSS classes for every component, you compose styles using small, reusable utility classes.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Traditional CSS often leads to:

- Large CSS files
- Naming conflicts
- Hard-to-maintain stylesheets

Tailwind takes a different approach by focusing on **composition over abstraction**.

### Key benefits:

- No context switching between HTML and CSS
- Predictable and consistent design
- Faster development once you learn the utilities

## Utility-First Approach

In Tailwind, you style elements like this:

```html
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg">
  Click me
</button>
```
